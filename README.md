## Project Description
For a while now I have wanted to build a native Windows application. I have tried multiple different frameworks and this project is the result of me trying to learn how to use C# and the Microsoft WinUI 3 frameowrk to build a native Windows Application. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/

## Installing the Project
Unfortunately it is impossible to install this project without opening it and running it in Visual Studio. There is no simple .exe file to click on because Microsoft wants the Windows Store to be how these programs are distributed.
